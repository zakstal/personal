  Cover_letter:
    # -interviewers might ask you where you learned to code. At that point you want to give the full story.
    # Build a template with these classy touches:
    #   - Have a minimally styled header that includes your contact information.
    #   - Below that insert the date.
    #   - Below that insert the name / title / company name / work address of the person you''re writing to.
    # -In the subject line, name the position you''re applying for and the city it''s in, separated by a dash.
    # -This way you can start off strong with a "I am a web developer with experience in X, Y and Z".
    # -Somewhere in your letter write two sentences about the company and why you want to work there.
    # -cover these points
    #     -What are your skills?
    #     -What is your background (if it is relevant)?
    #     -What kind of company do you want to join? (Keep this generic.)
    #     -What about this company matches that? (The one sentence you might change for each application.)
    #     -Mention the materials you're sending along (résumé + github + one or two live links).
    #
    #     -Addressing the letter when you don't know the name of the person reading it:
    #
    #     -Use "Hello [company] team" if they''re a laidback company.
    #     -Use "Dear Sir or Madam" if they seem stiff.
    # -Set up a signature with your mail client. Include the link to your portfolio site.
